# simplon_ent

Here is a kid of ENT (Virtual Learning Environment) developped by Simplon.
It was on a 2-days run, with a lead developer, and divided in 3 groups (15 developpers in total)

Our customer wanted a kind of VLE for a school, with some priorities: a way to reserve days for lunch, a personnal environment, different if the person who log in was a parent, administration or a teacher, and a way to access library.
